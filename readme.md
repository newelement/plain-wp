#Plain. Website - Wordpress Theme

WIP a.k.a. much todo

Plain Wordpress Version

This is a side project of mine. My goal is to do one page template per week. Page syles that I see I like or I do repeatedly.

I'm still working on some of the file/folder organization, so please excuse the mess. You are free to download and hack at will or contribute.
